Create a Header with a logo positioned on the left side, a search bar in the middle as shown in the UI, and three buttons arranged in a flex-box on the right side.


Create an "About Us" section and include images and text for all three tag lines as shown in the Figma design. Additionally, display a clock and a "Know More" button on the right side. The clock is available as a PNG file that can be exported from Figma and then imported into your design.


Also create an "Our Categories" section that includes cards as shown in the UI design. Each card should display a category name, a description for that category, and a "Know More" button. The cards should have a rounded border and be arranged in a flexbox with the flex-wrap property enabled.


Finally, create footer that matches the UI design. The left side of the footer should include the logo with a description below it. In the middle of the footer display the site map and on the right side display links to socials.
